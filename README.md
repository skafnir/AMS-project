Appointment Management System

Web application on Django that allows creating services (name, type, description, duration, price) and setting appointments in which user can choose services + suitable date. User has 'my appointments' page where he can check all info (duration, price, etc), delete an appointment or check its status (appointment needs to be approved by admin).
